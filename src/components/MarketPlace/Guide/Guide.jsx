      <h3>How to create a MetaMask wallet?</h3>
      <p>
        MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum
        blockchain. It can be accessed through an app or through a browser
        extension.

        a new one.

      />
      <p>
        Step 5: Securely store the seed phrase for your wallet Click on “Click
        here to reveal secret words” to show the seed phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
        MetaMask requires that you store your seed phrase in a safe place. It is
        the only way to recover your funds should your device crash or your
        browser reset. We recommend you write it down. The most common method is
        to write your 12-word phrase on a piece of paper and store it safely in
        a place where only you have access. Note: if you lose your seed phrase,
        MetaMask can’t help you recover your wallet and your funds will be lost
        forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never share your seed phrase or your private key to anyone or any site,
        unless you want them to have full control over your funds.

      />
      <p>Click on “Next”.</p>
      <p>
        Step 6: Seed phrase confirmation Confirm your secret backup phrase by
        clicking on each word in the order in which the words were presented on
        the previous screen. Click on “Confirm” to proceed.
